## My Projects üößüõ†Ô∏èüöß

Throughout the Mobile App Development Bootcamp, I have created several applications, utilizing different resources for each. Below, I showcase some of these apps.

## Practice for the Design Patterns module at Keepcoding.
In this practice, I develop a small app using Xcode and the Swift language under the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern. All the data is loaded directly from Xcode through a JSON that I created beforehand.

 ## Practice for the Advanced iOS module at Keepcoding.
In this practice, I develop a small app using Xcode and the Swift language under the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern. For its development, external libraries such as Kingfisher and Keychain have been used. Additionally, we have utilized CoreData and MapKit for the first time.

 ## Practice for the SuperPowers module at KeepCoding.
In this practice, I develop a small app using Xcode and the Swift language under the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern. For its development, the ViewInspector library has been used to conduct tests. Additionally, we delve into SwiftUI and use Combine.

 I am also developing apps on my own and in my free time to solidify all the knowledge gained throughout the Bootcamp. I currently have two apps in development, and I hope to finish them soon.
 
 ## AppFitness.
 In this app, we can input our user data in the User Registration section, and it will calculate our BMI, indicating the range we fall into. It also has the function to record your own exercises in the Exercise Log to track progress in terms of time intensity and/or the weight used during execution. On the other hand, there is a Statistics window that displays user information over time.

  ## Calculator-Conversion.
  Through this app, I want to build a calculator that includes the option for conversions. These conversions will cover units of measurement, time, temperature, currency, and much more. Additionally, it will feature both conventional and unconventional units of measurement.
