## My Projects üößüõ†Ô∏èüöß

In my spare time, I am constantly exploring and developing apps using new libraries and resources to expand my knowledge. I believe that the key to success lies in continuous learning and staying up-to-date.

Below, you'll find highlights of what I've developed for various platforms and in different programming languages. You can access detailed descriptions, images, and the source code of each project.







  ## Practice for the Android Fundamentals module at KeepCoding.
In this practice I develop a small app with Android Studio and Kotlin language. When running the application, we find a login that will give us access to a list of iconic heroes of the manga series, Dragon Ball, and we can simulate inflicting damage or healing the selected hero. If a character's health reaches zero, we will not be able to select him again, unless we use the resurrection button in the bottom right corner. This button will heal all characters to one hundred percent.

 ## Practice for the Android SuperPowers module at KeepCoding.
In this practice we develop a small app with Android Studio and Kotlin language under the MVVM (Model View ViewModel) design pattern. For its development, we are introduced for the first time in Jetpack Compose.
