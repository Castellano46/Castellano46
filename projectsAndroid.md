# Estética Mari App.
**Estética Mari App** is my second application developed for a local business, soon to be available for download on the **Play Store**. This app offers a complete and personalized experience for **Estética Mari** clients, allowing them to explore detailed beauty services, manage their profile, and receive notifications with exclusive promotions. 
With features like registration via Email, Google, or Facebook, and an intuitive menu with sections like **Profile**, **About**, and **Contact** enable users to navigate and customize their experience easily. The app is lightweight and relies on **Firebase** to provide a smooth interaction with minimal storage usage.

## Tu primer Lambo.

This is a playful app I'm developing, inspired by the controversial Llados and the way his students treat his words as gospel. The app features a motivational onboarding that leads to the main menu. From there, users can track their workouts and set morning alarms, with progress reflected in a calendar. Staying consistent every day brings users closer to their ultimate goal: becoming the owner of a Lamborghini.

## Padel Kuatro.

This app is a key milestone as it marks the first app I developed and launched for use by a local business to serve its customers. It represents the initial steps we took in creating a booking and reservation management service for a padel court. I was responsible for developing the entire Android section, and together with a colleague, we built the app using Firebase.

Additionally, you can explore the apps I developed during the Bootcamp I completed at Keepcoding. These projects were instrumental in building the foundation of my knowledge and skills.

  ## Practice for the Android Fundamentals module at KeepCoding.
In this practice I develop a small app with Android Studio and Kotlin language. When running the application, we find a login that will give us access to a list of iconic heroes of the manga series, Dragon Ball, and we can simulate inflicting damage or healing the selected hero. If a character's health reaches zero, we will not be able to select him again, unless we use the resurrection button in the bottom right corner. This button will heal all characters to one hundred percent.

 ## Practice for the Android SuperPowers module at KeepCoding.
In this practice we develop a small app with Android Studio and Kotlin language under the MVVM (Model View ViewModel) design pattern. For its development, we are introduced for the first time in Jetpack Compose.
