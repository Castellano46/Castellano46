Below, you will find the apps I have developed so far, along with those still in progress. Each entry includes representative images and a brief description.

## Padel Kuatro.

This app is a key milestone as it marks the first app I developed and launched for use by a local business to serve its customers. It represents the initial steps we took in creating a booking and reservation management service for a padel court. I was responsible for developing the entire Android section, and together with a colleague, we built the app using Firebase.

Additionally, you can explore the apps I developed during the Bootcamp I completed at Keepcoding. These projects were instrumental in building the foundation of my knowledge and skills.

  ## Practice for the Android Fundamentals module at KeepCoding.
In this practice I develop a small app with Android Studio and Kotlin language. When running the application, we find a login that will give us access to a list of iconic heroes of the manga series, Dragon Ball, and we can simulate inflicting damage or healing the selected hero. If a character's health reaches zero, we will not be able to select him again, unless we use the resurrection button in the bottom right corner. This button will heal all characters to one hundred percent.

 ## Practice for the Android SuperPowers module at KeepCoding.
In this practice we develop a small app with Android Studio and Kotlin language under the MVVM (Model View ViewModel) design pattern. For its development, we are introduced for the first time in Jetpack Compose.
