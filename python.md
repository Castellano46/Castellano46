## Access Control System

In this project, I developed a fully functional access control system using Arduino and Python. The system includes an RFID card reader, an LCD screen for user interaction, a push button for navigating the menus, a buzzer to notify access status, and red and green LEDs to indicate whether access is granted or denied.
With this program, you can register or remove clients and maintain a complete log of all business activity. Each time a card is scanned, the system records the data in an Excel file, capturing information such as UID, name, access granted/denied, date and time, and whether it was an entry or an exit.
