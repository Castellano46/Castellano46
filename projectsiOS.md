Below, you will find the apps I am currently developing, along with those still in progress. Each entry includes representative images and a brief description.

## Cifras y Letras
This app brings the classic TV game show "Cifras y letras" to your mobile screen. It features a splash screen that leads to the main menu, where you can play the game, view high scores, or check the game instructions. Additionally, it has a fully customized icon.

The game consists of two parts:

- Letters Rounds: In these rounds, you choose between vowels and consonants, which will appear randomly. The goal is to form the longest word possible. You earn one point for each letter used.
- Numbers Round: Random numbers are presented, and you must use basic mathematical operations to reach the target number or get as close as possible.
Both challenges have a 40-second timer.

 ## CinePro.
 In this app, we can enter our user data in the User Registration section, and it will calculate our BMI, indicating the range in which we are. It also has the function on registering our own exercises in the Exercise Log to track progress in terms of time intensity and/or weight used during execution. On the other hand, there is a Statistics window that shows user information over time.

 ## CocinApp.
In this App we have a Login screen as a first view that when entering our data (previously registered in the Spoonacular API) we will be able to access the content of the App. It is still under development but the idea is to have a recipe search engine that allows us to find the recipe that best suits our needs at all times. We will be able to select the one we want to see its ingredients and how to prepare it, we will also have a Favourites section and a section where we will be able to create our own recipes and menus, joining several dishes from the App.

   ## Notes.
I developed this app to practice in a very simple way the MVVM architecture. With it we will be able to organise our day including all the tasks we have to do. First of all, we will have the option to create any task, which will be added to our to-do list, called 'TO-DO'. When we decide to tackle a specific task, we will move it to the to-do list, called 'IN-Progress'. Finally, once we have completed a task, it will be automatically moved to the list of completed tasks, entitled 'Done'.

  ## Calculator-Conversion.
  Through this app, I want to build a calculator that includes the option of conversions. These conversions will cover units of measurement, time, temperature, currency, and much more. In addition, it will include conventional and non-conventional units of measurement.

Additionally, you can explore the apps I developed during the Bootcamp I completed at Keepcoding. These projects were instrumental in building the foundation of my knowledge and skills.

 ## Practice for the Advanced iOS module at Keepcoding.
In this practice, I develop a small app using Xcode and the Swift language under the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern. For its development I have used external libraries like Kingfisher and Keychain. In addition, I have used CoreData and MapKit for the first time.

 ## Practice for the SuperPowers module at KeepCoding.
In this practice, I develop a small app using Xcode and the Swift language under the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern. For its development, the ViewInspector library has been used for testing. In addition, we went deeper into SwiftUI and Combine.

## Practice for the iOS Fundamentals module at Keepcoding.
In this practice, I'm developing a small app using Xcode and the Swift language, consuming the Dragon Ball API. For the first time, we dive right into the development of an iOS app; it's our initial encounter with something tangible in the app development process.

## Practice for the Design Patterns module at Keepcoding.
In this practice, I develop a small app using Xcode and the Swift language under the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern. All the data is loaded directly from Xcode through a JSON that I have previously created.
