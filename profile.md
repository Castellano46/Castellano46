# Professional Profile üìùüíªüì±

## Technical Skills:
I am a developer specialized in building native iOS apps, skillfully using Swift, UIKit and SwiftUI. 
My experience includes implementing solid design patterns, such as MVVM and MVC, to ensure code modularity and maintainability. 
I possess in-depth knowledge of essential iOS components, highlighting my proficiency in handling ViewControllers, TableViews, CollectionViews and Navigation Controllers.

## Tools and Environments:
My development environment par excellence is Xcode, which I have mastered as an integrated development environment (IDE) efficiently. 
I have used Interface Builder extensively to design high quality user interfaces. 
In addition, I am adept at version control, employing Git, GitHub and GitFlow for collaborative and organised development.

## Frameworks and Libraries:
My experience encompasses the use of fundamental tools such as Core Data and SwiftData for efficient data management in iOS applications. 
For the security of sensitive user information, I employ Keychain rigorously. By integrating MapKit, I achieve robust mapping and location implementations. 
My reactive programming skills are evident through the use of Combine and RXSwift, as well as the use of Async Await to optimise navigation fluidity and improve code readability and maintainability. 
In addition, I excel at creating complex animations using Core Animation.

## Testing and Code Quality:
I place great importance on code robustness, so I implement unit tests with XCTest consistently. 
I also ensure a smooth end-user experience by implementing user interface testing.

## Dependency Management:
My effective approach to dependency management is reflected in my expert use of CocoaPods and Swift Package Manager. 
I strategically integrate and manage external libraries to improve development efficiency.

## User Interface Design:
My design skills excel through the creation of attractive and functional interfaces, using both UIKit and SwiftUI. 
I combine aesthetics and usability to deliver exceptional user experiences.
